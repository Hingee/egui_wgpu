# Crate: wgpu-server
`wgpu-server` is a Rust HTTP server designed to serve and execute a WebGPU-enabled webpage generated by the `web_gpu_window` crate.

## Responsibilities
- Hosts the compiled WebAssembly package.
- Serves static assets from:
```
static/pkg
```
- Provides a local environment for testing high-performance WebGPU rendering.

## Running the Server
Use the parent directory script:
```
sh run.sh -run
```

## Structure
- `src/main.rs` — Server entry point.
- `static/pkg/` — Contains `.wasm` and `.js` output built from the `web_gpu_window` crate.

## Notes
This crate only hosts the files. All rendering is done client‑side by the wasm‑generated page.
